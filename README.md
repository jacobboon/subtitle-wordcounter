# subtitle-wordcounter
Counts all the words in (UTF-8 encoded) .srt files in a folder

This was written in python 3.4, so be weary of version issues when running on 2.x

Many words that are heavily used in the English language have been filtered out of the results (even out of the counting algorithm). You can easily change which words are left out by editing the contents of 'excludes.txt'.
